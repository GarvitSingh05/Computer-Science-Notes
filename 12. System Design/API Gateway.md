# API Gateway

An API Gateway is a critical component of modern IT infrastructure that facilitates communication between clients, applications, and services. Positioned between clients and services, it offers centralized management of API communication, delivering security, policy enforcement, and monitoring across diverse environments such as on-premises, multi-cloud, and hybrid setups.

## What is an API Gateway?

An API Gateway functions by receiving API requests from clients, processing them based on predefined policies, directing them to the relevant services, and consolidating responses for a seamless user experience. It often handles requests by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating results, simplifying complex interactions. Additionally, it can translate between protocols in legacy systems.

## API Gateway Capabilities

API Gateways commonly incorporate several capabilities, including:

- **Security Policy**: Encompassing authentication, authorization, access control, and encryption.
- **Routing Policy**: Covering routing, rate limiting, request/response manipulation, load balancing, and more.
- **Observability Policy**: Providing real-time and historical metrics, logging, and tracing for monitoring.

## Benefits of API Gateway

Deploying an API Gateway for app delivery yields numerous benefits, including:

- **Reduced Complexity**: Encapsulating internal application architecture, offering APIs tailored for each client type, and speeding up app releases.
- **Streamlined Processing**: Centralized control point for request processing and policy enforcement, simplifying troubleshooting.
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Granular real-time and historical metrics, dashboards, and observability features for efficient monitoring.

## API Gateway and Microservices Architecture

In a microservices-based architecture, an API Gateway serves as a single entry point, simplifying both client implementations and microservices. Responsible for routing, composition, and policy enforcement, it decouples app complexity from clients, enabling developers to focus on core logic and accelerating app releases.

## API Gateway for Kubernetes

For containerized microservices on Kubernetes, an API Gateway can be deployed at various levels, such as:

- Multi-cluster level as a load balancer.
- Cluster level at the edge as an Ingress controller.
- Service level within the Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes-native tools like NGINX Ingress Controller and NGINX Service Mesh are recommended for API Gateway deployments, ensuring tight integration with the Kubernetes API.

## API Gateway vs. Ingress Controller vs. Service Mesh

While Ingress controllers manage user-to-service or north-south connectivity in Kubernetes, API Gateways offer enhanced capabilities, including security policies and advanced routing. The NGINX Ingress Controller, for example, can function as a full-featured API Gateway at the edge.

## Service Mesh vs. API Gateway

A service mesh, focused on east-west connectivity among services, provides core capabilities like load balancing, authentication, authorization, and observability. Deployed closer to apps and services, it can serve as a lightweight API Gateway for service-to-service communications in Kubernetes.

## API Gateway and API Management

API Gateway and API Management, although often used interchangeably, differ in functionality. An API Gateway acts as a data-plane entry point for API calls, while API Management involves deploying, documenting, operating, and monitoring individual APIs through management-plane software.

## Considerations for Choosing an API Gateway

Several factors influence the choice of an API Gateway:

- **Architecture**: Consider deployment locations, platform flexibility, and runtime agnosticism.
- **Performance**: Ensure high throughput and low latency to meet traffic demands.
- **Scalability**: Support both vertical (throughput) and horizontal (availability) scaling.
- **Security**: Offer access control, mTLS, integrated WAF, and security features.
- **Cost**: Understand the total cost of ownership, comparing custom solutions to enterprise-grade API gateways.
