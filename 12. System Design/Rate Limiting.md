# Rate Limiting: Enhancing Cybersecurity in Web Applications

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is a cybersecurity technique that restricts network traffic to prevent the depletion of system resources. It helps combat attacks like Denial of Service (DoS), where malicious actors flood a system with requests, overwhelming network capacity, storage, and memory.

APIs utilizing rate limiting can throttle or block clients exceeding a defined number of API calls. This ensures legitimate requests can access the system without compromising overall application performance.

## Importance of Rate Limiting

### Addressing Threats:

#### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Mitigates DDoS threats by preventing excessive requests from a single traffic source. Challenges include identifying distributed attacks.

#### Credential Stuffing

Identifies and blocks bots attempting unauthorized access using stolen credentials, avoiding account takeover.

#### Brute Force

Blocks systematic submission of randomly generated credentials, preserving network resources against large-scale attacks.

#### Data Scraping and Theft

Detects and blocks scraping bots aiming to steal valuable information from target websites.

#### Inventory Denial

Prevents inventory hoarding attacks by blocking bots initiating transactions without completion, ensuring availability for legitimate users.

## How Rate Limiting Works

Rate limiting operates within applications, tracking request origins through IP addresses. It measures elapsed time and request frequency, throttling IPs exceeding limits in set timeframes.

### Types of Rate Limits

1. **User Rate Limits:**
    
    - Most common method, tracks requests per user using IP addresses or API keys.
    - Exceeding limits triggers denial until the timeframe resets.

2. **Geographic Rate Limits:**
    
    - Enhances security by setting region-specific rate limits.
    - Adjusts limits based on predicted user activity in specific timeframes.

3. **Server Rate Limits:**
    
    - Set at the server level, offering flexibility to adjust limits for different server roles.

## Algorithms Used for Rate Limiting

### 1. Fixed-window Rate Limiting

- Restricts requests within a fixed timeframe.
- Limits reset at specific intervals, controlling requests per minute.

### 2. Leaky Bucket Rate Limiting

- Focuses on fixed-length request queues, serving on a first-come, first-serve basis.
- Drops new requests if the queue is full.

### 3. Sliding-window Rate Limiting

- Similar to fixed-window but starts the timeframe with each new request.
- Offers flexibility and addresses issues in fixed-window rate limiting.

Rate limiting is an integral part of a robust cybersecurity strategy, safeguarding web applications against various malicious activities.
