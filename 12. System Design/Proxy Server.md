# Proxy Servers: Gateway to Secure and Controlled Internet Access

## Proxy Server Definition

A **proxy server** acts as a gateway between users and the internet, preventing cyber attackers from infiltrating private networks. It serves as an intermediary, managing web requests and responses.

## Proxy Servers and Network Security

Proxies enhance computer security by functioning as web filters or firewalls, safeguarding against internet threats like malware. They offer an additional layer of protection when combined with secure web gateways or email security products.

## How a Proxy Works

- Utilizes its own IP address as a mediator between a computer and the internet.
- Routes requests to the proxy, which fetches responses from web servers and forwards data to the user's browser.

## Types of Proxies

### Forward Proxy

- Positioned in front of clients, deciding whether to proceed with a connection.
- Ideal for internal networks requiring a single point of entry.

### Transparent Proxy

- Provides a user experience similar to direct internet access.
- Can be forced on users without their awareness.

### Anonymous Proxy

- Focuses on making internet activity untraceable.
- Grants full anonymity while accessing the internet.

### High Anonymity Proxy

- Erases user information before connecting to the target site.
- Suitable for users requiring absolute anonymity.

### Distorting Proxy

- Identifies as a proxy to a website but hides its own identity.
- Useful for hiding location while accessing the internet.

### Data Center Proxy

- Provided by a corporation through a data center, not affiliated with an ISP.
- Offers quick response times and cost-effective solutions.

### Residential Proxy

- Assigns an IP address belonging to a specific physical device.
- Suitable for verifying ads on websites, ensuring trustworthiness.

### Public Proxy

- Accessible by anyone free of charge.
- Best for users where cost is a major concern, sacrificing some security and speed.

### Shared Proxy

- Used by more than one user simultaneously.
- Low-cost option but may lead to blame for others' actions.

### SSL Proxy

- Provides decryption between the client and the server.
- Enhances protection against SSL protocol threats.

### Rotating Proxy

- Assigns a different IP address to each connecting user.
- Ideal for high-volume, continuous web scraping.

### Reverse Proxy

- Positioned in front of web servers, forwarding requests to them.
- Balances the load for popular websites, reducing bandwidth load.

## Setting Up a Proxy Server

- Configured in computers, devices, or networks.
- Setup involves using an automatic configuration script or entering IP address and port manually.

## Proxy Benefits

- **Enhanced Security:** Acts as a firewall between systems and the internet.
- **Private Browsing:** Shields online activities, making tracking impossible.
- **Access to Location-Specific Content:** Allows users to appear in different countries.
- **Control Over Employee Web Access:** Blocks inappropriate or distracting sites.

## Proxy Server Applications
