# Distributed Locking Patterns and Anti-patterns

## 1. Centralized Locking

**Pattern:**

- Utilizes a centralized service or component (e.g., database, message queue, ZooKeeper) for managing locks on shared resources.
- Provides strong consistency and atomicity guarantees.

**Pros:**

- Easy to implement and reason about.
- Strong consistency and atomicity.

**Cons:**

- Single point of failure.
- Potential bottleneck at scale.
- Increased network overhead and latency.

_Insights:_

- Centralized locking results in a single point of failure and might become a potential bottleneck at a large scale. It's like having a building with many doors but only a single key.

## 2. Consensus-based Locking

**Pattern:**

- Uses consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) to elect a leader among nodes.
- Delegates locking responsibility to the leader, which acts as a centralized lock manager.

**Pros:**

- Tolerant to node failures.
- Fault-tolerant and consistent locking semantics.

**Cons:**

- Complex to implement and maintain.
- Network overhead and latency for consensus.

_Insights:_

- Consensus-based locking involves a leader node that can provide fault-tolerant and consistent locking semantics but may introduce complexity and communication overhead.

## 3. Decentralized Locking

**Pattern:**

- Utilizes decentralized schemes like DHT, gossip protocol, or logical clock for distributing locks without a central authority.
- Distributes locks among nodes without reliance on a leader.

**Pros:**

- Improves scalability and availability.
- Reduces network overhead and latency.

**Cons:**

- Weaker consistency and synchronization guarantees.
- Prone to conflicts and collisions.

_Insights:_

- Decentralized locking with DHT, gossip protocols, or logical clocks enhances scalability and availability but may introduce weaker consistency guarantees.

## 4. Optimistic Locking

**Anti-pattern:**

- Assumes conflicts are rare and does not acquire a lock before accessing or modifying a shared resource.
- Checks resource version before and after the operation, aborts or retries if the resource has changed.

**Pros:**

- Avoids blocking and waiting for locks.
- Improves performance and concurrency.

**Cons:**

- More aborts and retries.
- Increases complexity of conflict detection and resolution.

_Insights:_

- Optimistic locking, used by DynamoDB, avoids blocking but increases complexity and client-side burden for resolving version conflicts.

## 5. Lock-free Algorithms

**Anti-pattern:**

- Uses lock-free algorithms that rely on atomic operations like compare-and-swap (CAS) instead of traditional locks.
- Eliminates deadlock, livelock, and starvation issues.

**Pros:**

- Eliminates deadlock and related issues.
- Achieves high performance and scalability.

**Cons:**

- Difficult to design and implement correctly.
- Limited applicability and functionality.

_Insights:_

- Lock-free algorithms can eliminate deadlock issues but are challenging to design and implement correctly.

## 6. Lock Coupling

**Anti-pattern:**

- Acquires multiple locks simultaneously or holds one lock while acquiring another.
- Can lead to deadlock situations.

**Solution:**

- Implements lock ordering to define a global or partial order for acquiring locks and prevent circular dependencies.
