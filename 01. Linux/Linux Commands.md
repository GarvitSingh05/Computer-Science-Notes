1. pwd - Prints the current working directory.

2. cd - Change working directory. EXamples : 
	- Change directory from Home directory(represented by ~) to Downloads. When you are somewhere inside your Home directory, the terminal uses ~ as an abbreviation.
	```Shell
	cd Downloads
	```
	- Go up to the parent directory. '..' means previous directory. '.' means current directory.
	```Shell
	cd ..
	```
	- Move up through mutiple levels of parent directories.
	```Shell
	cd ../..
	```
	- Switch to the root directory, then follow the route from there towards the directory 'etc'
	```Shell
	cd /etc
	```
	- cd command requires you to provide atmost one arguement or no arguement. Cannot be more than one.

3. whoami - Prints your username.

4. mkdir 'Directory Name' - Create a new directory. Examples :
	- Create a folder named 'abc' in the current directory.
	```Shell
	mkdir abc
	```
	- Create a folder named 'gs' in the Downloads directory. It will first go to the Home directory(represented by ~), then go to the Downloads directory and create a directory named 'gs' in it.
	```Shell
	mkdir ~/Downloads/gs
	```
	- Switch to root directory, then create tmp directory and src directory inside tmp.
	```Shell
	mkdir /tmp/src
	```
	- Creates all folders in the current directory.
	```Shell
	mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
	```
	- Here, dir4 is created and dir5 is created inside dir4 and dir6 is further created in dir5. We use the -p switch which creates the parent directories as decribed in the arguement.
	```Shell
	mkdir -p dir4/dir5/dir6
	```
	- mkdir command requires you to provide atleast one arguement.

5. ls - list command. Displays files & directories in a directory. 
	- Use the -a switch to list the hidden files like the .bashrc file.
	- Capture the output of the command in a text file, we use the greater than(>) sign.
	```Shell
	ls > result.txt
	```
6. echo - Prints the provided arguement in the terminal.
	```Shell
	echo "Hello"
	```

7. cat - Displays the content of the file in the terminal. If you pass more than one filename, it will output each one of them, one after the other. 'cat' comes from the word concatenate which means to link together.
	- Display the content of sample.txt stored in dir1.
	```Shell
	cat dir1/sample.txt
	```

8. mv - Move command. mv command lets you move more than one file at a time. If you pass more than two arguements, the last one is taken to be the destination directory and the others are considered to be the files or directories to be moved.
	- Here, abc.txt and dir1 will be moved to dir2
	```Shell
	mv abc.txt dir1 dir2
	```
	- Here, abc.txt(located in dir1) will be moved to dir4 which is inside dir3 which is further inside dir2.
	```Shell
	mv dir1/abc.txt dir2/dir3/dir4
	```
	- To rename a file, use the mv command. Here, abc.txt is renamed to xyz.txt. Works on both files and directories.
	```Shell
	mv abc.txt xyz.txt
	```
	
9. cp - Copy command.

	rm h*
	```

	```Shell
	rm -r dir1
	```
	- Use -i switch with rm command which will prompt you to confirm the deletion of each file. Here, we are deleting all files(represented by * ) in the dir3

	```
	
11. rmdir - Remove directory command. If there are any files in the directories, then they will not be deleted.
	- Here, we are deleting multiple directories at the same time which are stored in a hierarchy. Use the -p switch with rmdir command for this purpose. It deletes dir3 first, then dir2 is deleted and finally dir1 is deleted. Files contained in these directories will not be deleted.
	```Shell
	rmdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
	```

12. wc - word count command. Use the -l switch to know line count.
