### Cloud Deployment Models
#### By Garvit Singh

###### **Cloud Deployment Models**
4 Models : Public, Private, Hybrid, Community

1. **Public Cloud**
	- In a public cloud deployment, cloud resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and are made available to the general public or a broad range of customers.
	- These resources are hosted and managed in data centers owned by the service provider, and users can access them over the internet.
	- Public clouds offer scalability and cost-effectiveness, as users only pay for the resources they consume.
	- Examples of public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.

2. **Private Cloud**
	- A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization and is typically hosted in on-premises data centers or provided by a third-party cloud provider exclusively for that organization.
	- It offers more control, security, and customization options compared to public clouds. It's ideal for organizations with stringent data security and compliance requirements.
	- Private clouds can be more expensive to set up and maintain because they require dedicated hardware and infrastructure.
	- They are suitable for enterprises, government agencies, and industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as healthcare and finance.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**
	- A hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It's a flexible approach that offers a balance between control and scalability.
	- Organizations can use a private cloud for sensitive data and applications, while leveraging the scalability and cost-effectiveness of a public cloud for other workloads.
	- Hybrid cloud enables data and workload portability, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.
	- It's well-suited for businesses that want to maintain some control over their data while taking advantage of the benefits of public cloud resources.

4. **Community Cloud**
	- A community cloud is shared among multiple organizations with common interests or requirements, such as compliance with industry-specific regulations.
	- It can be hosted by one of the organizations, a third-party provider, or a consortium of organizations.
	- Access to a community cloud is typically restricted to the members of the community, ensuring that data and applications are shared among trusted parties.
	- Community clouds are common in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, where multiple organizations need to collaborate while adhering to specific standards.
