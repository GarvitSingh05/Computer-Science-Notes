### Cloud Storage

###### **Cloud Storage**
Cloud storage is a fundamental component of cloud computing, providing scalable and on-demand storage resources that can be accessed over the internet.

Object storage is suitable for unstructured data and web applications, block storage provides low-level access for structured data, file storage enables shared file systems, and CDNs improve the performance and security of content delivery. 

1. **Object Storage**:
	- Object storage is a type of cloud storage that stores data as objects or files in a flat structure, each identified by a unique key (often referred to as a "universal resource identifier" or URI). 
	- Objects typically consist of the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier.
	- Object storage is highly scalable and suitable for storing vast amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, documents, and backups. 
	- It's often used for web applications, content distribution, and data archival.
	- Popular object storage services include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

2. **Block Storage**:
	- Block storage divides data into fixed-size blocks and stores them on individual storage devices. 
	- Unlike object storage, it is used for structured data, such as databases, virtual machines, and operating systems.
	- Block storage provides high performance and low-latency access, making it suitable for applications that require direct, low-level access to storage, like databases and virtualization environments.
	- Cloud providers offer block storage services, such as Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), Google Persistent Disks, and Azure Disk Storage.

3. **File Storage**:
	- File storage offers a file-based approach to storage, where data is organized into a hierarchical structure of directories and files. 
	- It is often used for shared file systems and is accessible over network protocols like SMB (Server Message Block) and NFS (Network File System).
	- File storage is valuable for workloads that require a shared and accessible file system, like user home directories, shared drives, and application data shared among multiple instances.
	- Cloud providers offer file storage services, such as Amazon EFS (Elastic File System), Google Cloud Filestore, and Azure Files.

4. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**:
	- CDNs are a network of distributed servers strategically placed in various geographical locations to optimize the delivery of web content and digital assets like images, videos, and web pages.
	- When a user requests content from a website, the CDN serves the content from the nearest server to reduce latency and improve load times.
	- CDNs not only enhance content delivery but also protect websites from DDoS attacks by distributing traffic and providing additional security features.
	- Leading CDN providers include Akamai, Cloudflare, and Amazon CloudFront.
