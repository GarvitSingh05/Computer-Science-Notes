###### **Cloud Service Models**
Each layer provides a different service to users. 

IaaS solutions are sought by users that want to leverage Cloud computing from building dynamically scalable computing systems requiring a specific software stack. IaaS services are therefore used to develop scalable websites or for background processing.

IaaS solutions target mostly end users, who want to benefit from the elastic scalability of the Cloud without doing any software development, installation, configuration, and maintainence. SaaS service providers often utilise this.

PaaS solutions provide scalable programming platforms for developing applications, and are useful when new systems have to be developed.

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
	- Consists of Virtualised Servers, Storage and Networking
	- IaaS solutions deliver infrastructure on demand in the form of virtual hardware, storage and networking.
	- Virtual hardware is utilized to provide compute on demand in the form of virtual machine instances.
	- These are created on user's request on the provider's infrastructure, and users are given tools and interfaces to configure the software stack installed in the VM.
	- Pricing model is usually defined in terms of dollars per hours.
	- Virtual storage is delivered in the form of raw disk space or object store.
	- Raw disk space is a virtual hardware that has persistent storage.
	- Object storage is a high level abstraction for storing entities rather than files. It is a data storage architecture for storing unstructured data, which sections data into units object and stores them in a structurally flat data environment.
	- Vitual networking identifies the collection of services that manage the networking among virtual instances and their connectivity towards the internet or private networks.
	- Ex - Amazon(EC2, S3), Rightscale, vCloud etc.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
	- Consists of Runtime Environment for Applications, Development and Data Processing Platforms.
	- PaaS deliver scalable and elastic runtime environments on demand that host the execution of applications.
	- These services are backed by a core middleware platform that is responsible for creating the abstract environment where applications are deployed and executed.
	- The service provider takes care of scalability and managing fault-tolerance, while Users focus on logic of the application developed by leveraging the provider's APIs and libraries.
	- This approach increases the level of abstraction but also constrains the user in a more controlled environment.
	- Ex - Windows Azure, Hadoop, Google AppEngine, Aneka etc.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
	- Consists of End-user applications like social networking, photo editing, CRM etc.
	- Provides applications and services on demand.
	- Most common desktop applications are replicated on the provider's infrastructure, made more scalable, and accessible through a browser on demand. 
	- These applications are shared across multiple users, whose interaction is isolated from other users.
	- The SaaS Layer is the one that includes Social Networking websites, which leverage cloud based infrastructures to sustain the load generated by their popularity.
	- Ex - Shopify, Adobe, Twiiter, Zoom, Salesforce etc.

4. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**
	- FaaS is also known as Serverless Computing.
	- It is a cloud computing model in which cloud providers manage the infrastructure and automatically allocate resources as needed for executing individual functions or pieces of code.
	- In FaaS architecture, you write and deploy small, self-contained functions or microservices, and the cloud provider takes care of scaling, managing, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.
	- FaaS is an excellent choice for applications that have variable workloads and need to respond quickly to events.
	- It's commonly used for web applications, microservices, data processing, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
	- Ex - AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, Alibaba Cloud Function Compute etc.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

###### **Cloud Deployment Models**
4 Models : Public, Private, Hybrid, Community

1. **Public Cloud**
	- In a public cloud deployment, cloud resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and are made available to the general public or a broad range of customers.
	- These resources are hosted and managed in data centers owned by the service provider, and users can access them over the internet.
	- Public clouds offer scalability and cost-effectiveness, as users only pay for the resources they consume.
	- Examples of public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.

2. **Private Cloud**
	- A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization and is typically hosted in on-premises data centers or provided by a third-party cloud provider exclusively for that organization.
	- It offers more control, security, and customization options compared to public clouds. It's ideal for organizations with stringent data security and compliance requirements.
	- Private clouds can be more expensive to set up and maintain because they require dedicated hardware and infrastructure.
	- They are suitable for enterprises, government agencies, and industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as healthcare and finance.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**
	- A hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It's a flexible approach that offers a balance between control and scalability.
	- Organizations can use a private cloud for sensitive data and applications, while leveraging the scalability and cost-effectiveness of a public cloud for other workloads.
	- Hybrid cloud enables data and workload portability, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.
	- It's well-suited for businesses that want to maintain some control over their data while taking advantage of the benefits of public cloud resources.

4. **Community Cloud**
	- A community cloud is shared among multiple organizations with common interests or requirements, such as compliance with industry-specific regulations.
	- It can be hosted by one of the organizations, a third-party provider, or a consortium of organizations.
	- Access to a community cloud is typically restricted to the members of the community, ensuring that data and applications are shared among trusted parties.
	- Community clouds are common in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, where multiple organizations need to collaborate while adhering to specific standards.

###### **Virtualization**
Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple virtual instances of computer resources within a single physical machine. 

It enables better resource utilization, improved scalability, and increased flexibility in managing and deploying applications and services. 

There are different approaches to virtualization, including hypervisors, containerization, and virtual machines(VMs).

1. **Hypervisors**
	- A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software or hardware layer that creates and manages multiple virtual machines on a single physical server.
	- There are two main types of hypervisors:
		- **Type 1 Hypervisor**: This runs directly on the host hardware and doesn't require a host operating system. Ex - VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
		- **Type 2 Hypervisor**: This runs on top of a host operating system and is often used for development and testing. Ex - Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.
	- Hypervisors provide strong isolation between virtual machines, making them suitable for running different operating systems and applications on the same physical server.
	- Each virtual machine (VM) created by a hypervisor has its own virtualized hardware and can run an independent operating system.

2. **Containerization**
	- Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single unit called a container.
	- Containers share the host operating system's kernel and use the same resources, making them highly efficient and fast to start and stop.
	- Docker is one of the most popular containerization platforms, and it uses container images to package applications and their dependencies. These images can be easily distributed and deployed across various environments.
	- Containers are typically used to isolate applications rather than entire operating systems, making them an excellent choice for microservices architectures and cloud-native applications.

3. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
	- Virtual machines are complete emulations of physical computers, including a full operating system, running on a hypervisor.
	- Each VM runs its own guest operating system, which may be different from the host operating system. This allows for running multiple distinct operating systems on a single physical server.
	- VMs offer strong isolation between workloads, making them suitable for scenarios where security and complete separation are crucial.
	- VMs can be used for various purposes, from running legacy applications to creating test environments and disaster recovery solutions.

**Characterstics Of Virtualized Environments**
1. **Increased Security**
- Virtualization enhances security in several ways. By isolating workloads or applications in separate virtual machines (VMs) or containers, vulnerabilities in one component are less likely to impact others. 
- Security policies and access controls can be applied at the virtualization layer to protect data and resources. Snapshots and backups in virtualized environments make disaster recovery and data protection more accessible.

2. **Managed Execution**
- Managed execution in virtualized environments involves various techniques for controlling and optimizing resource utilization.
	- a) **Sharing**
		- Virtualization allows for the sharing of physical resources among multiple VMs or containers. 
		- This sharing maximizes resource utilization and cost-efficiency.
	- b) **Aggregation**
		- Virtualization platforms can aggregate the computational power of multiple physical servers, creating resource pools that can be allocated to VMs dynamically.
	- c) **Emulation**
		- Some virtualization approaches, such as full virtualization, use emulation to run guest operating systems on a different architecture. 
		- This enables running legacy applications on modern hardware.
	- d) **Isolation**
		- Isolation ensures that VMs or containers run independently, with their own isolated file systems, processes, and network configurations. 
		- Isolation helps prevent interference between workloads.

3. **Portability**
- Virtualization enhances application and workload portability. 
- Virtual machines or containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments, from on-premises servers to public or private clouds. 
- This portability simplifies deployment, migration, and scaling of applications.

**Execution Virtualization**
A technology that enables the creation of virtual environments or virtual machines (VMs) within a physical computing system. 

These virtual environments mimic the behavior of actual physical hardware or software, allowing multiple isolated instances to run concurrently on the same physical machine.

1. **Machine Reference Model**
- This concept refers to the virtualization of an entire computing system, which replicates a reference model of a physical machine. 
- It serves as a foundation for various virtualization techniques, allowing multiple virtual machines to operate independently on the same physical hardware.

2. **Hardware Level Virtualization**
- Hardware level virtualization, also known as system virtualization, involves creating multiple VMs that directly interact with the underlying hardware. 
- Each VM has its own dedicated resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. The virtualization software (hypervisor) manages and isolates these VMs from one another.

3. **Hardware Virtualization Techniques**
- a) **Hardware-assisted Virtualization**
	- This technique utilizes hardware features, like Intel VT-x and AMD-V, to improve the performance and security of virtualization. 
	- It enables VMs to execute instructions directly on the physical CPU, reducing the need for complex emulation.
- b) **Full Virtualization**
	- In full virtualization, the VMs run unmodified guest operating systems, believing they are running on real hardware. 
	- The hypervisor intercepts and emulates privileged instructions, making it appear as if the VMs have full control over the hardware.
- c) **Paravirtualization**
	- Paravirtualization involves modifying the guest operating systems to be aware of their virtualized environment. 
	- This awareness allows for better performance and efficiency, as the guest OS can make direct calls to the hypervisor for certain operations.
- d) **Partial Virtualization**
	- Partial virtualization is a less common approach where only specific aspects of a system are virtualized, rather than the entire hardware stack. It may involve virtualizing specific devices or resources.

4. **Operating System Level Virtualization**
- Also known as containerization, this virtualization method creates isolated environments at the operating system level.
- Containers share the host OS kernel but have their own user spaces, allowing for efficient resource utilization and fast startup times.
- Docker and Kubernetes are popular tools for managing containers.

5. **Programming Language Level Virtualization**
- This is often referred to as language-level virtualization. 
- It involves creating isolated runtime environments for a specific programming language. 
- Examples include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for Java and the Common Language Runtime (CLR) for .NET languages. 
- These runtime environments provide a level of abstraction that allows applications to run independently of the host platform.

6. **Application Level Virtualization**
- Application-level virtualization focuses on virtualizing specific applications rather than entire operating systems or hardware. 
- This approach encapsulates an application and its dependencies into a self-contained package, making it portable and isolated from the host environment. 
- Examples include application virtualization solutions like VMware ThinApp and Microsoft App-V.

**Other Types Of Virtualization**
1. **Storage Virtualization**
- Storage virtualization abstracts and pools physical storage resources from various storage devices into a single virtual storage unit. 
- This abstraction allows for centralized management and improved utilization of storage capacity. 
- It can be implemented at different levels, such as file-level, block-level, or object-level virtualization, and is often used in storage area networks (SANs) and network-attached storage (NAS) environments.

2. **Network Virtualization**
- Network virtualization is the creation of multiple virtual networks on a single physical network infrastructure. 
- It abstracts network resources, such as switches, routers, and even IP addresses, allowing multiple virtual networks to coexist independently. 
- This technology is particularly valuable in cloud computing, data centers, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. 
- Network virtualization can improve network flexibility, security, and scalability.

3. **Desktop Virtualization**
- Desktop virtualization, often known as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), separates a user's desktop environment from the physical device, such as a PC or thin client. 
- It allows users to access their desktops from various devices and locations, while the actual computing takes place on a server in a data center. 
- This enhances security, centralizes management, and simplifies application deployment and updates.

4. **Application-Server Virtualization**
- Application-server virtualization, also known as application virtualization or server virtualization, focuses on running multiple instances of applications or application servers on a single physical server. 
- This is accomplished by abstracting the underlying server hardware and operating system, allowing applications to operate in isolated environments. 
- This approach simplifies application deployment, improves resource utilization, and enhances application availability and scalability.

**Advantages & Disadvantages Of Virtualization**
**Advantages**
1. **Resource Consolidation**
- Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, which optimizes resource utilization. 
- This results in cost savings as fewer physical servers are needed.

2. **Isolation**
- VMs are isolated from each other, which means problems in one VM are less likely to affect others. 
- This isolation enhances security and stability.

3. **Flexibility and Scalability**
- Virtualized environments can easily scale up or down, making it simpler to adapt to changing workload requirements.

4. **Disaster Recovery**
- Virtualization makes backup and disaster recovery processes more efficient. 
- VM snapshots and replication can quickly restore VMs in case of failures.

5. **Efficient Testing and Development**
- Virtualization allows for the creation of isolated development and test environments, reducing the risk of interfering with production systems.

6. **Hardware Independence**
- VMs are not tied to specific hardware, making them more portable and easier to migrate between physical hosts.

7. **Energy Efficiency**
- By consolidating workloads onto fewer physical servers, virtualization can lead to energy savings and a reduced carbon footprint.

8. **Easy Software Deployment**
- Virtual appliances and images make it simple to deploy and manage software across different environments.

**Disadvantages**
1. **Overhead**
- There is a performance overhead associated with virtualization, as the hypervisor adds some latency and resource consumption. 
- This can affect the performance of resource-intensive applications.

2. **Licensing Costs**
- Virtualization software and management tools can be expensive. 
- Licensing models can also be complex, making cost management challenging.

3. **Resource Contention**
- If not managed properly, resource contention among VMs on the same host can lead to performance degradation. 
- This requires careful resource allocation and monitoring.

4. **Complexity**
- Managing virtualized environments can be complex, especially in large deployments.
- Proper planning and expertise are needed to ensure optimal performance and security.

5. **Security Risks**
- While virtualization provides isolation, vulnerabilities in the hypervisor or misconfigurations can lead to security risks.
- Attackers could potentially compromise the entire virtualized environment.

6. **Vendor Lock-In**
- Some virtualization platforms have proprietary features and formats, making it challenging to migrate VMs to other platforms or cloud services.

7. **Backup and Recovery Complexity**
- While virtualization can enhance disaster recovery, managing backups and recovery processes for a large number of VMs can be complicated.

8. **Limited Hardware Support**
- Virtualization may not support certain types of hardware or require specific hardware features for optimal performance, limiting hardware choices.

###### **Distributed Computing**
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. 

It is a computing environment where multiple computers or nodes work together to achieve a common goal. 

These systems can be organized in various ways, including mainframes, clusters, and grids, each with its unique characteristics and use cases.

1. **Mainframe Computing**
	- Mainframes are large, powerful, and centralized computing systems that can process a vast amount of data and handle many concurrent users.
	- They have traditionally been used in enterprises, government organizations, and industries where reliability, scalability, and security are of utmost importance.
	- Mainframes are known for their robustness, high availability, and support for large-scale transaction processing.
	- In a mainframe-based distributed system, the mainframe serves as the central hub or control unit, while other devices or terminals connect to it for processing tasks. This model is highly reliable and well-suited for critical applications like banking and airline reservation systems.

 2. **Cluster Computing**
	- Clusters are collections of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together as a single system. These nodes are often commodity hardware or servers.
	- Clusters can be categorized into high-availability clusters, load-balancing clusters, and high-performance clusters, depending on their purpose.
	- High-availability clusters are designed to provide fault tolerance and ensure system availability. If one node fails, another node takes over.
	- Load-balancing clusters distribute workloads across multiple nodes to improve performance and ensure efficient resource utilization.
	- High-performance clusters are used for parallel computing and scientific simulations, where the processing power of multiple nodes is harnessed to solve complex problems faster.

3. **Grid Computing**
	- Grid computing involves connecting distributed and often heterogeneous resources, such as computers, storage, and data, to form a seamless and virtualized computing environment.
	- Grids are typically used for scientific and research applications that require massive computational power, data storage, and collaboration across different organizations.
	- Grids allow resources to be shared and accessed remotely, enabling researchers to leverage computing power and data storage facilities that may be distributed across the globe.
	- An example of grid computing is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, where scientists from various countries collaborate by sharing and analyzing massive datasets.

4. **High Performance Computing(HPC)**
	- Uses distributed computing facilities for solving problems that need large computing power.
	- Supercomputers and clusters are specifically designed to support HPC applications to solve challenging scientific and engineering problems.

5. **High Throughput Computing(HTC)**
	- Uses distributed computing facilities for applications requiring large computing power over a long period of time.
	- HTC systems need to be robust and reliably operate over a long time scale.

6. **Many Tasks Computing(MTC)**
	- Bridges the gap between HPC & HTC.
	- MTC is similar to High Throughput Computing, but it concentrates on the use of many computing resources over a short period of time to accomplish many computational tasks.


**Remote Procedure Call(RPC)**
A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that enables a program to execute code or procedures on a remote server as if they were local, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for remote communication. RPC allows programs to request services or functions from a server or another application running on a different machine or in a different process.

RPC is used in distributed computing and remote service invocation scenarios, such as client-server applications, microservices, and distributed systems. It abstracts the complexities of network communication, making it easier for developers to build applications that span multiple machines or processes while maintaining a seamless developer experience, much like invoking local functions.

Common examples of RPC frameworks include gRPC, Apache Thrift, Java RMI etc. 

1. **Client-Server Interaction**
- RPC involves a client (the requester) and a server (the provider of services). 
- The client sends a request to the server to execute a specific function or procedure.

2. **Procedure Call Semantics**
- RPC abstracts the invocation of remote procedures to make it resemble a local function call. 
- The client calls a function on the server as if it were a local function.

3. **Stubs**
- To make remote calls look like local calls, RPC systems often use stubs or proxies. 
- The client-side stub marshals the parameters, sends the request to the server, and unmarshals the results. 
- The server-side stub receives the request, unpacks the parameters, calls the actual function, and sends the results back.

4. **Marshalling and Unmarshalling**
- Marshalling is the process of converting function parameters and return values into a format suitable for transmission, often in a binary or text format. 
- Unmarshalling is the reverse process on the server side, converting the transmitted data back into usable parameters and results.

5. **Transport Protocol**
- RPC systems typically use a transport protocol (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, or custom protocols) to transmit the request and receive the response between the client and server.

6. **Binding**
- Binding is the process of associating a specific remote procedure with its corresponding server address and communication details. 
- It can be done statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at runtime).

7. **IDL (Interface Definition Language)**
- Many RPC systems use IDL to define the interface between the client and server. 
- The IDL provides a platform-independent way to describe data types, functions, and procedures, making it easier for client and server code to interact.

**Distributed Object Frameworks**
Also known as Distributed Object Computing (DOC) frameworks or Distributed Object Middleware, are software frameworks and technologies that facilitate the development of distributed applications by extending the concept of object-oriented programming to distributed systems. 

Distributed Object Frameworks simplify the development of distributed systems by providing a higher-level, object-oriented abstraction for network communication. They have been used in various domains, including enterprise applications, telecommunications, and distributed systems where flexibility, scalability, and interoperability are critical.

These frameworks enable objects (software components) to interact with one another seamlessly, even when they are located on different machines within a network or distributed environment.

Key features and concepts of Distributed Object Frameworks include:

1. **Object-Oriented Paradigm**
- Distributed Object Frameworks are built upon the principles of object-oriented programming.
- They enable objects to communicate and collaborate in a distributed environment, preserving the object-oriented model's encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Location Transparency**
- Distributed objects are designed to be location-transparent, meaning that clients interact with objects using the same syntax and method calls regardless of the object's physical location.
- This abstracts the complexities of network communication.

3. **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**
- Distributed Object Frameworks typically use remote method invocation mechanisms to allow objects to invoke methods on remote objects as if they were local. 
- This involves serializing method parameters and sending them over the network to the remote object for execution.

4. **Object Serialization**
- Objects must be serializable, meaning they can be converted into a format that can be transmitted over the network and reconstructed as objects on the remote side.

5. **Object Activation**
- Some distributed object frameworks support object activation, where objects can be created on-demand on remote servers. 
- This allows resources to be allocated dynamically based on demand.

6. **Security and Access Control**
- Distributed Object Frameworks often include mechanisms for secure communication and access control, ensuring that only authorized clients can access and invoke methods on distributed objects.

7. **Middleware Services**
- These frameworks may provide additional middleware services such as naming and directory services, transaction management, and event notification, which simplify the development of distributed applications.

8. **Interoperability**
- Distributed Object Frameworks aim to be platform-agnostic and support interoperability across various programming languages and platforms.

**Popular Distributed Object Frameworks**

1. **Common Object Request Broker Architecture(CORBA)**
- A platform-agnostic middleware that enables interoperability between objects in different languages and on different platforms.

2. **Java Remote Method Invocation(RMI)**
- A Java-based framework for remote communication between objects, allowing Java objects to interact over a network.

3. **Distributed Component Object Model(DCOM)**
- A Microsoft technology that extends the Component Object Model(COM) to support distributed computing in Windows environments.

4. **Enterprise JavaBeans(EJB)**
- A component architecture for building distributed business applications using Java. 
- It provides a framework for building and running distributed, transactional, and secure enterprise applications.

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
It is a design approach and architectural style for developing software systems that promote the use of services as fundamental building blocks. 

In SOA, a service is a self-contained, modular unit of functionality that is designed to be independent, reusable, and interoperable. 

The goal of SOA is to create a flexible and scalable architecture that supports the efficient integration of disparate systems and applications. 

1. **Standardized Service Contract**
- A standardized service contract defines the interface and interaction patterns for a service.
- This contract includes information about how to access the service, what it does, and the data formats it uses. 
- Standardization ensures that services can be easily discovered, understood, and integrated into applications.

2. **Loose Coupling**
- Loose coupling refers to the degree of dependency between services. 
- In SOA, services are designed to be loosely coupled, which means they are relatively independent and can function without intimate knowledge of each other. 
- Loose coupling enhances flexibility, as changes to one service have minimal impact on other services.

3. **Abstraction**
- Abstraction involves hiding the complex details of a service's implementation and exposing only the necessary information through the service contract. 
- This simplifies the interaction with the service and allows for changes in the underlying implementation without affecting service consumers.

4. **Reusability**
- Reusability is a key principle in SOA. Services are designed to be reusable components that can be utilized in various applications and contexts. 
- This reduces development effort and enhances consistency across the organization.

5. **Autonomy**
- Services in SOA are autonomous, meaning they have control over their own functionality and data. 
- Autonomy allows services to evolve independently and make decisions about their operations.

6. **Lack of State**
- Services in SOA are typically designed to be stateless, which means they don't retain information about previous interactions with clients. 
- This simplifies the management and scalability of services.

7. **Discoverability**
- Discoverability is the ability for clients to find and access services easily. 
- Services should be discoverable through directories, registries, or service metadata.
- Discoverability is crucial for enabling service integration.

8. **Composability**
- Composability refers to the ability to combine and orchestrate services to create more complex, higher-level applications. 
- SOA promotes the creation of composite applications through the assembly of services.

###### **Parallel Computing**
1. Parallel Systems refer to tightly coupled systems. 
2. The term 'Parallel Computing' refers to a model where the computation is divided among several processors sharing the same memory. 
3. The architecture of a parallel computing system is characterised by homogeneity of components, each processor is of the same type and posseses the same capabilities. 
4. The shared memory has a single address space, which is accessible to all the processors. 
5. Parallel programs are then broken down into several units of executions that can be allocated to different processors, and can communicate with each other through the shared memory. 

**What is Parallel Processing?**
- Processing of multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processors is called parallel processing.
- The parallel program consists of multiple active processes(tasks) simultaneously solving a given problem.
- A given task is divided into mutiple subtasks using divide-and-conquer technique, and each one of them is processed on different CPUs.
- Programming on multi-processor system using divide-and-conquer technique is called parallel programming.
- Parallel processing provides a cost-effective solution by increasing the number of CPUs in a computer and by adding an efficient communication system between them.
- The workload can now be shared between different processors. This results in higher computing power and performance than a single processor system.

**Hardware Architectures for Parallel Processing**
The core elements of parallel processing are CPUs. Based on a number of instruction and data streams that can be processed simultaneously, computing systems are classified into four categories:
- Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)
- Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
- Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)
- Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)

1. **Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)**
	- A SISD Computing system is a uniprocessor machine capable of executing a single instruction, which operates on a single data stream.
	- In SISD, machine instructions are processed sequentially, and hence computers adopting this model are popularly called sequential computers.
	- All the instructions and data to be processed have to be stored in the primary memory.

2. **Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)**
	- A SIMD computing system is a multiprocessor machine capable of executing the same instruction on all CPUs, but operating of different data streams.
	- Machines based on SIMD model are well suited for scientific computing since they involve lots of vector and matrix operations.

3. **Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)**
	- A MISD computing system is a multiprocessor machine capable of executing different instructions on different processors, but all of them operate on the same data set.
	- Machine built using MISD model are not useful for most applications, they lack practical application.

4. **Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)**
	- A MIMD computing system is a multiprocessor machine capable of executing multiple instructions on multiple data sets.
	- Each processor in MIMD has separate instructions and data streams, and hence machine built using this model are well suited for all kinds of applications.
	- Processors in MIMD work asynchronously.
	- MIMD machine are classified into the following
		1. **Shared Memory MIMD Machine**
			- All processors are connected to a single global memory and they all have access to it. 
			- Systems based on this model are also called tightly-coupled multiprocessor systems. 
			- The communication between processors takes place through the shared memory.
			- Easier to program but less tolerant to failures and hard to extend.
		
		2. **Distributed Memory MIMD Machine**
			- All processors have a local memory
			- Also called loosely coupled multiprocessor systems
			- Communication between processors takes place through the interconnection network. The network can be configured to tree, mesh, cube etc.
			- Each processor operates asynchronously.
			- More tolerant to failures and easier to extend.
			- Distributed MIMD architectures are better than Shared Memory MIMD in every way.

**Approaches To Parallel Programming**
1. **Data Parallelism**
- Divide & conquer technique is used to split data into multiple sets and each data set is processed by different processors using the same instruction.

2. **Process Parallelism**

###### **Serverless Architectures**
Serverless computing is a cloud computing paradigm that allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying server infrastructure. In a serverless architecture, cloud providers automatically manage server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus exclusively on writing code to handle specific functions or tasks. Key features of serverless architectures include:

**Function as a Service (FaaS)**
- Serverless computing typically revolves around the concept of functions. 
- These are individual units of code that are triggered by events or requests. 
- When an event occurs, such as an HTTP request or data upload, the corresponding function is executed, and resources are allocated dynamically for the duration of that function's execution.

**Scalability**
- Serverless platforms automatically scale resources up or down based on the number of incoming requests or events. 
- This means your application can handle high traffic without manual intervention.

**Pay-as-You-Go Billing**
- With serverless, you are billed only for the actual compute resources used during the execution of functions. 
- This is in contrast to traditional server-based models, where you pay for reserved or provisioned resources.

**Event-Driven**
- Serverless applications are inherently event-driven, responding to triggers and events that initiate the execution of specific functions.


###### **Event-Driven Architectures**
Event-driven architectures are a design approach in which software components communicate and interact through events. Events are typically generated by various system components, such as user actions, data changes, or external integrations. These events trigger actions or functions that respond to the event. Key characteristics of event-driven architectures include:

**Loose Coupling**
- Components in an event-driven architecture are loosely coupled. 
- They don't directly call each other's functions but instead emit and consume events. 
- This decoupling makes it easier to change, update, or extend components independently.

**Asynchronous Communication**
- Events are typically processed asynchronously.
- When an event is generated, the system doesn't wait for an immediate response. 
- Instead, it continues processing other tasks and allows event handlers to respond when they are ready.

**Scalability**
- Event-driven architectures naturally support scalability. 
- New instances of event handlers can be added as the volume of incoming events increases, allowing the system to handle greater loads.

**Flexibility**
- Event-driven systems are highly flexible and adaptable. 
- They can respond to a wide range of events and can be easily extended or modified to accommodate new event types or changes in business logic.

###### **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Cloud**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are computational techniques that enable systems to learn from data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks without explicit programming. 

Leveraging AI and ML in the cloud offers scalability, accessibility, and ease of deployment. 

**Cloud-Based AI/ML Services**
Cloud providers offer a range of services that facilitate the development, training, and deployment of AI and ML models. These services are designed to make it easier for organizations to incorporate AI and ML capabilities into their applications. Some key cloud-based AI/ML services include:

1. **Amazon SageMaker (AWS)**

	- IBM Watson offers AI and ML services that encompass natural language processing, computer vision, and decision optimization.
	- It provides tools for data preparation, model training, and deployment, as well as support for developing chatbots and AI-powered applications.

**Model Training and Deployment**
AI and ML models typically go through two key phases: training and deployment.

1. **Model Training**
	- Training involves feeding a machine learning algorithm with labeled data to teach it how to make predictions or decisions. 
	- In the cloud, this process often requires significant computational power, which cloud providers offer in the form of scalable resources.
	- Cloud-based ML platforms provide tools for data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and distributed training.

2. **Model Deployment**
	- Once an ML model is trained, it needs to be deployed so that it can be used to make predictions or provide insights in real-time.
	- Cloud services make model deployment straightforward, with features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and integration with other cloud services.
	- Models can be deployed as web services or APIs, making it easy to integrate them into web and mobile applications.
