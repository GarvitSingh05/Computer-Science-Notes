### **Gas Price**
The price you pay to ethereum miners to carry out your transaction on the ethereum blockchain. With ETH 2.0 the gas prices must have fallen drastically. So keep that in mind.

### **3 Phases Of A New Collection**

### **Some Tips**
- When ETH price goes up, the volume of NFTs traded on OpenSea goes down. They are inversely proportional to each other. Trade NFTs only when they are in bull run or when ethereum is in bear market. In a bear market, only buy NFT Projects that are really hyped or the projects you really believe in.
- Always buy an NFT 1-2 days before the pre-reveal. The people who could not get whitelisted now want to buy that NFT and they push the price higher. Buy before the price is pushed higher by people. And sell when the reveal happens.
- Use polygon blockchain to avoid high gas fees on ethereum blockchain. ETH is most popular and mostly used. But polygon etc can also be used.
